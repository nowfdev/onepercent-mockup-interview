| Feature                       | `$(document).ready()`                                                                                                  | `window.onload`                                                                               |

| **When it fires**             | When the **DOM is fully loaded and parsed**, but **before images, stylesheets, and other resources are fully loaded**. | When **everything** on the page is fully loaded, including images, stylesheets, iframes, etc. |
| **Usage**                     | Commonly used in jQuery to safely run code as soon as the DOM is ready for manipulation.                               | Native JavaScript event, runs later than `$(document).ready()`.                               |
| **Multiple handlers support** | Supports multiple handlers without overwriting each other.                                                             | Can overwrite if multiple handlers assigned improperly (unless using `addEventListener`).     |
| **Performance**               | Fires earlier, so UI interactions can be initialized sooner.                                                           | Fires later, may delay execution if large resources are loading.                              |
